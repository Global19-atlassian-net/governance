# Cosmos Governance

The Cosmos Hub ("Gaia") has an on-chain governance mechanism for passing text
proposals, changing consensus parameters, and spending funds from the community
pool.

This repository provides background information on these different kinds of proposals
and best-practices for drafting them and proposing them on-chain. 

It also provides a place for collaborating on draft proposals in plain text on Github.

It may also come to serve as a place where proposals can be committed to, and
potentially even modified slightly during voting. This would complement and/or
augment current practices of posting proposals as PDF files to IPFS.
