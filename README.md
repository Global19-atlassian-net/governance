# Cosmos Hub 3 and the Community Pool
The Cosmos Hub 3 launched with community-spend capabilities on December 11, 2019, effectively unlocking the potential for token-holders to vote to approve spending from the Community Pool.

### How is the Community Pool funded?
2% of all staking rewards generated are immediately transferred to the Community Pool.

### How is the Community Pool spent?
Funds from the Cosmos Community Pool may be spent via successful governance proposal. Currently, these
proposals operate the same way signaling proposals and parameter change proposals operate: a 14-day lifespan and minimum
deposit of 512 ATOM is required for the proposal to enter the voting period. A proposal requires a minimum of 40% of voting
power in order to meet quorum, followed by a simple majority of participating voting power backing the 'yes' option 
ie. the 'yes' vote exceeds 50%.

### How are funds disbursed?
If a community-spend proposal passes successfully, the number of ATOM encoded in the proposal will be transferred to
the address encoded in the proposal, and this will happen immediately after the voting period ends.
